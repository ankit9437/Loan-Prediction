# Loan-Prediction
Implementing various ML algo and then finding the best prediction among various applied algo. I have implemented various classification algos like Gaussian Naive-Bayes, KNN, Decision tree classifier and then checked accuracy score of each algo. It was found that for the given dataset Gaussian Naive-Bayes had the highest accuracy.
#Data-set
The data set consist of various details of user like Loan-ID, Gender, Marrital status, Education, Employement, Loan-Amount, Credit-History etc. The null values in the dataset were replaced with the avreage+deviation or average-deviation value. The string were also converted to numeric value.
